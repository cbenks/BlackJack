      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The goal of BlackJack is to have the total value of your cards equal to 21, or as close as possible without going over!</li>
        <li>A is equal to 1 or 11. K, Q, and J are equal to 10, and the rest of the cards are equal to their respective values.</li>
        <li>You will always go first. You begin with two cards face up, while you can only see one of the dealers two cards to begin. </li>
        <li>Now you will decide whether to "HIT" - take another card OR "STAND" - end your turn and stay with the two cards you have.</li>
        <li>If your cards total value is over 21 you automatically lose. If it is 21, you automatically win. Otherwise it will be the dealers turn to go.</li>
        <li>After the dealer goes, whoevers final hand is closer to 21 wins, and if it is a tie then it is considered a "PUSH" and there is no winner.</li>
      </ul>
