# BlackJack

## _Description_

---

Welcome to my first project - the classic game of BlackJack. This will be built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## _Gameplay_

---

- The user (Player) is going to compete against the computer (dealer).
- The object of the game is to have the total value of your combined cards equal to 21, or as close as possible without going over that number.
- If the player goes over they automatically lose.
- If the player is under 21 then can choose to "stand" on the current value of their hand and use that as their final value, or they can choose to take more cards to potentially bring them closer without exceeding 21.
- If the players' final value of their hand is under 21 and greater than the dealers, they win.
- If the dealer goes over 21 the player wins, and if there is a tie no one wins.
